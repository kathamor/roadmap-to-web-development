        <p>What is a bulleted list in HTML?
          HTML Unordered List or Bulleted List displays elements in bulleted format . We can use unordered list where we do not need to display items in any particular order. The HTML ul tag is used for the unordered list.</p>
      </li>
      <!--<ul> = The HTML <ul> element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
Usage notes
The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.
The <ul> and <ol> elements may be nested as deeply as desired. Moreover, the nested lists may alternate between <ol> and <ul> without restriction.
The <ol> and <ul> elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful. As a rule of thumb to determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the <ol> element should be used, otherwise you can use <ul>.-->
