Note : When using auto complete features inside Atom. You can just write the element and it will  make a suggestion for what you are asking for and when you hit the enter you will get the tag inserted automatically. ( open and close, and the curser moved right in between just exactly the place where you need to start typing )

Note : How to keep your HTML file neat and tidy?
( Indent and Structure )
Having indents to your HTML file, makes it easy to see at glance which tags are inside other ones. ( If you don't want to do it manually all the time download Atom Beautify and click Beautify, and it will automatically beautify your entire code file to make all of the indent for you , and look everything neat and tidy. )

Note : It's good practice to use emphasis instead of italic because it conveys more information and it isn't just about the style.
Remember : When we're writing html code we're more concerned about structuring our text rather that caring about how it looks or how it appears.
Now a similar pair is the b tag or the bold tag, and this is equivalent to i tag, it make any text in between bolded like so but instead what you should be using is the strong tag, and that's because the strong tag again confers meaning, it says that this text has strong importance and therefore its displayed in bold rather than merely saying that this should be styled so that it's darker than the rest of the text. ( you can read bold and strong , emphasis and strong, emphasis and italic )
Reference :
<p> = paragraph tag / formats text into paragraph so they get a new line and the text inside grouped together into the same paragraph
<i> = italicizes the text; it only style the text to make it slanted and it doesn't confer any of that emphasis.
<em>=emphasis element/tells the browser the words that enclosed between it should be stressed or should emphasized.
<b>=bold tag.
<strong> =The HTML Strong Importance Element (<strong>) indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
Atom Beautify = it will automatically beautify your entire code file to make all of the indent for you , and look everything neat and tidy-->
