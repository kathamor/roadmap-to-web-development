    <!--Boilerplate
  <!DOCTYPE html> = Document type-Tells the browser what is the version of the HTML is using
  <html lang="en" dir="ltr"> = HTML tag, this tells the browser that everything in between the opening and closing tags is going to be HTML codes ( consists of a head and a body )

  <head> Head = part of the HTML file that holds information about the webpage, and it tells the browser how it should handle the page.
  <meta charset="utf-8"> = Inside the head section there is also this meta element in the example below is called character set and the one that were setting it to is "utf-8". The meta elements gives extra meta data or associated data to your HTML document. And in this case we're telling the browser when it opens up this file that all the text inside our webpage is encoded using the "utf-8" encoding system (list of available characters that we can use inside a website )
  Note : sometimes when you open up a webpage especially an outdated browser like internet explorer, you might see some of the characters being jumbled up and this is called : Mojibake - A japanese word that stands for characters that are trasnformed and it occurs because your browser is trying to render the characters using the wrong character set.There's different type of encoding and they specialized for different languages, because different languages used different symbols. utf-8 is the standard encoding that should be used when working in HTML5, the reason for that is because it includes all of those international symbols and in fact every single symbol that is included in the unicode chracter set. So everything that is unicode can be encoded correctly using utf-8, and it something that you should just have as your boilerplate code for any new website you create.This gives your website a maximum chance of being rendered correctly on browsers that are from international visitors.

  Other meta attributes :
  <head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  </head>
  **THESE META TAGS tell the browser how it should render or display the webpage, and also they give informations to search engines about the content of the website ( see :   <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials"> ) see also : developer.mozilla.org , right click and view page source ) if you search for description attribute, it says : <meta name="description" content="The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps. It also has some developer-oriented documentation for Mozilla products, such as Firefox Developer Tools.">  if you go into google and search for mdn, you can see that snippet text that it shows about the main mdn website, is exactly the same in the description meta tag, And this is what search engines do, they crawl the html of your website and look for certain meta tags in order to know , what your website is about and also how to display it in their search index ( see mdn web docs for different attributes for the meta element. )
