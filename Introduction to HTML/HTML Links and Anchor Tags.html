  <h3>How to create hyperlinks using anchor tags</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Hypertext - So hypertext is basically just a bunch of text documents that can be linked together using these hyperlinks. So when you click on one of them, it takes you to a different text document, and then you click on the link there and it
        takes you to another different text document. And that's where the HT part of HTML comes from.</p></li>
    <li><p>Anchor Tag</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li> a - HTML Element</li>
        <li> href- HTML Attribute and this is set to equal the link destination</li>
        <li>Anchor tag is not a closing a self-closing tag So it has a closing tag at the end and between the open tag and the closing tag is our link text.</li>
        <li> Hello - Link text that's the bit of text that's going to be underlined and highlighted in blueso that the user knows that when they click on this word, this is going to take them to that link.</li>
       <br><img src="Images/anchor tag html.png" alt=anchor tag html style="width:800px;height:500px;=">
      </ul>
    <li><p>How to create a link that linked to your own page?</p></li>
       <ul>
      <li>Head back into Atom and inside this HTML personal site folder where you've got your index.html</li>
      <li>Just right-click and click new file, and its going to be created inside the same folder as index. They must be in the same hierarchical level.</li>
      <li>Add HTML boilerplate code for your new file ( ex. for hobbies.html )</li>
      <li>Then add the Title and body( ex My Hobbies )</li>
      <li>Save the html for your hobbies</li>
      <li>Go back to index.html and create a new anchor tag that's going to have the link text ( example : of your hobbies ) and the href is going to be the file name, in this case it will be hobbies.html. Now if you hit save and go back to your website, hit refresh that ordered list has disappeared and is now replaced by this hyperlink. And if you click on it, it takes you to this brand new page that you've created called my hobbies.</li>
      <li><em><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong></em>  you can really easily start to create multiple pages of your website. And as long as you've got it inside the same folder or you can specify a path for the browser to get to it, then you can start linking up your homepage with all of these different satellite pages and you start to build up a website rather than just a web page.</li>
       </ul>
  </ul>
